## Crowd Fund Smart Contracts

The CrowdFund smart contract enables users to create crowdfunding campaigns using a predefined ERC20 token (specified during contract deployment). Campaign creators can set fundraising goals, start and end dates for their campaigns, and collect pledged funds when the campaign is successfully completed. Users can pledge funds to campaigns, and in the event that a campaign does not reach its goal, they can request a refund.

## Multi-Signature Wallet Smart contract


The multiSigWallet contract allows multiple owners to collectively manage a wallet's funds. Transactions can be submitted to the wallet, but they require approval from a specified number of owners before they can be executed. This contract enhances security by preventing unauthorized transactions.

## ERC20 smart Contract 

This is a Solidity smart contract implementing the ERC20 standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract defines functions and data structures that allow for the creation, transfer, and management of tokens adhering to the ERC20 specification.
